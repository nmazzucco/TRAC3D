# TRAC3D
TRAC3D is a repository designed to collect statistical routines for the analysis of 3D data related to use-wear traces (e.g., micropolish) measured using confocal microscopy. These statistical routines assist users in conducting blind classifications of a test set (i.e., archaeological data) against a training set (i.e., experimental data). Additionally, it provides a script for reducing the number of textural parameters to be used as predictors in the classification procedure by selecting the most significant ones.
